## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build --build-optimizer --base-href /abeemap/` to build the project.  
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Configure your web-server so that index.html is served from the `/abeemap` resource path.  
E.g.: `https://example.com/abeemap`
